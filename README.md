# Heart_Failure_Prediction_Analysis
With an estimated 17.9 million fatalities annually, or 31% of all deaths worldwide, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide. 
Heart attacks and strokes account for four of every five CVD deaths, with untimely deaths in those under 70 accounting for one-third of these cases. 
This dataset includes 11 variables that can be used to predict the possibility of a heart illness. Heart failure is a common event brought on by CVDs.

A machine learning model can be very helpful in the early detection and management of cardiovascular disease and high cardiovascular risk individuals 
(due to the existence of one or more risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or already established disease).
